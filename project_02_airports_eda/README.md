Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the OpenFlights Airports dataset
.
The goal is to uncover meaningful insights about the distribution of airports worldwide.

Visualizations & Insights
1. Top 10 Cities with Most Airports


Insight: Major cities dominate with the highest number of airports, reflecting their strategic importance in global connectivity.

2. Distribution of Airport Altitudes


Insight: Most airports are located at low altitudes, with only a small number at high elevations.

3. World Distribution of Airports


Insight: Airports are globally distributed, with dense clusters in North America and Europe.

4. Distribution of Airport Types


Insight: The dataset is dominated by major airports, while smaller categories (e.g., private or military airfields) make up a minority.

Key Findings

Airports are heavily concentrated in key global cities.

Most airports exist at low altitudes.

North America and Europe host the majority of airports.

The dataset is dominated by major airports.

Next Steps

Perform time-series analysis if temporal data is available.

Cluster airports geographically using K-Means or other clustering methods.

Integrate with airline route data to analyze connectivity patterns.
